bridge mode enhancements
updates to the pinoccio bridge command that make it usable as an unattended service in production.

pinoccio bridge
---------------

- observes serial device list to find a scout to bridge
- runs bridge connection in a child process to ensure stability
- child process drops privileges if run as root so as not to expose undue security risk
- on linux supports hard resetting the usb device if run as root.
- re bridges if for some reason it ever becomes disconnected and reconnected
- pings the bridge scout on an interval to make sure it's still running commands and sending reports for the troop
- will only bridge with the scout that is specified by the --port option or the first scout selected if more scouts are plugged in.
- supports selecting another bridge scout by watching for ctrl+c

pinoccio serial
---------------

- ignore empty lines instead of sending them to api just to get an error back later.
